abstract: Recently, it has been demonstrated that taking a disagreeing perspective
  increases the accuracy of inner crowds by enhancing estimation diversity. An insightful
  commentary reanalyzed the data using maximal random structure models and found no
  increase in accuracy when taking a disagreeing perspective. These findings present
  a curious challenge for inner-crowd research and hint at the importance of question
  variability. Here, we present the results of three preregistered experiments (total
  N = 2,884, with online adult participants from the United States and the United
  Kingdom) that reconcile these findings by discerning between the ease and difficulty
  of questions. The results support the notion that taking a disagreeing perspective
  is beneficial for difficult questions, yet harmful for easier questions. We emphasize
  that question difficulty is a key factor to consider when evaluating the effectiveness
  of any intervention designed to improve the accuracy of aggregate estimates through
  the enhancement of diversity.
