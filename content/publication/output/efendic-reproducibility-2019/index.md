abstract: Problematisation: In recent years, psychology has been going through a crisis
  of sorts. Research methods and practices have come under increased scrutiny, with
  many issues identified as negatively contributing to low replicability and reproducibility
  of psychological research.Implications: As a consequence, researchers are increasingly
  called upon to overhaul and improve their research process. Various stakeholders
  within the scientific community are arguing for more openness and rigor within industrial
  and organisational (I-O) psychological research. A lack of transparency and openness
  further fuels criticisms as to the credibility and trustworthiness of I-O psychology
  which negatively affects the evidence-based practices which it supports. Furthermore,
  traditional gate-keepers such as grant agencies, professional societies and journals,
  are adapting their policies, reflecting an effort to curtail these trends.Purpose: The
  purpose of this opinion paper is, therefore, to stimulate an open dialogue with
  the South African Journal of Industrial Psychology (SAJIP) contributing authors,
  its editorial board and readership about the challenges associated with the replication
  crisis in psychology. Furthermore, it attempts to discuss how the identified issues
  affect I-O psychology and how these could be managed through open science practices
  and other structural improvements within the SAJIP.Recommendations: We enumerate
  several easily implementable open science practices, methodological improvements
  and editorial policy enhancements to enhance credibility and transparency within
  the SAJIP. Relying on these, we recommend changes to the current practices that
  can be taken up by researchers and the SAJIP to improve reproducibility and replicability
  in I-O psychological science.
