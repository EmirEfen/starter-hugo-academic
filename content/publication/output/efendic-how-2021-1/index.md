abstract: Abstract  When making risk judgments, people rely on availability and affect
  as convenient heuristics. The two heuristics share many similarities and yet there
  have been no or few attempts to ascertain their causal impact on risk judgments.
  We present an experiment ( N = 143) where we varied availability‐by‐recall (thinking
  of less or more occurrences of someone from one's social network dying) and the
  affective impact of certain risks (using images). We found that availability‐by‐recall
  had a stronger impact in constructing risk judgments. Asking people to think of
  more occurrences led to higher judgments of mortality and higher values placed on
  a single life, irrespective of changes in affect, risk media coverage, and retrieval
  time. Affect, however, was not disregarded. Our data suggest a causal mechanism
  where the retrieval of occurrences leads to changes in affect, which in turn, impact
  risk judgments. These findings increase understanding of how risk judgments are
  constructed with the potential to impact risk communication through direct manipulations
  of availability and affect. We discuss these and other implications of our findings.
