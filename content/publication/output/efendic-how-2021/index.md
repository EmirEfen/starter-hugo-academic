abstract: 'Abstract People occasionally face sure loss prospects. Do they seek risk
  in search of better outcomes or contend with the sure loss and focus on what is
  left to be saved? We addressed this question in three experiments akin to a negative
  interest rate framework. Specifically, we asked participants to allocate money (Experiments
  1 and 2) or choose (Experiment 3) between two options: (i) a loss option where,
  for sure, they would end up with less, or (ii) a mixed gamble with a positive expected
  outcome, but also the possibility of an even larger loss. Risk aversion (i.e., choosing
  the sure loss) ranged from 80% to 36% across the three experiments, dependent on
  varied sizes of sure losses or expected outcomes. However, overall, the majority
  (textgreater 50%) of allocations and choices were for the sure loss. Our findings
  indicate a tolerance for sure losses at the expense of mixed gambles yielding much
  better expected outcomes. We discuss the implications of this sure-loss tolerance
  for psychological research, its implications in terms of (cumulative) prospect theory,
  and what the results mean for the implementation of negative interest rates.'
