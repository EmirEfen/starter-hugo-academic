abstract: Purpose Many service industries are facing severe labor shortages. As a
  result, service providers are turning to new sources of labor, such as service robots.
  Critics however often point out that service robots lack emotional communication
  capabilities without which they cannot be expected to truly replace human employees
  and fill the emerging labor market gaps. Here, a research agenda for the investigation
  of the role of emotional communication by service robots and its effects on customers
  and their service experience are laid out. This paper aims to propose that research
  in this area will further understanding of how service robots can add value to service
  frontlines, engage customers, increasingly replace service employees and ultimately
  help overcome pressing labor shortages.   Design/methodology/approach A research
  agenda structured around the three-step emotional communication process (i.e. read,
  decide and express) and the four emotional communication strategies crucial for
  service interactions (i.e. mimicking, alleviating, infusing and preventing) are
  conceptualized.   Findings Three contributions are made. First, the importance of
  emotional communication by service robots during service interactions is highlighted.
  Second, interdisciplinary research priorities and opportunities in this emerging
  field are mapped out. Third, a theoretical structure to connect the findings of
  future studies is provided.   Originality/value Service research investigating the
  role and implications of emotional communication by service robots is scarce. A
  research agenda to guide the exploration of this crucial, yet underresearched component
  of customer-robot service interactions is structured and mapped out.
