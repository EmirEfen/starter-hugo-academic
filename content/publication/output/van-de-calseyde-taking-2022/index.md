abstract: 'Many decisions rest on people’s ability to make estimates of unknown quantities.
  In these judgments, the aggregate estimate of a crowd of individuals is often more
  accurate than most individual estimates. Remarkably, similar principles apply when
  multiple estimates from the same person are aggregated, and a key challenge is to
  identify strategies that improve the accuracy of people’s aggregate estimates. Here,
  we present the following strategy: Combine people’s first estimate with their second
  estimate, made from the perspective of someone they often disagree with. In five
  preregistered experiments ( N = 6,425 adults; N = 53,086 estimates) with populations
  from the United States and United Kingdom, we found that such a strategy produced
  accurate estimates (compared with situations in which people made a second guess
  or when second estimates were made from the perspective of someone they often agree
  with). These results suggest that disagreement, often highlighted for its negative
  impact, is a powerful tool in producing accurate judgments.'
