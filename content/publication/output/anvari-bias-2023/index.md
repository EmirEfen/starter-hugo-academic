abstract: Researchers have long worried about a phenomenon where study participants
  give higher ratings on self-report scales the first time they take a survey compared
  to subsequent times, particularly for negative subjective experiences. Recent experimental
  evidence, using samples of U.S. college students, suggests that this initial elevation
  phenomenon is due to an upward bias in people’s initial responses. Such bias potentially
  undermines the validity of many research findings. However, more recent studies
  have found little evidence in support of the phenomenon. To investigate the robustness
  of the initial elevation phenomenon, we conducted the largest experiments to date
  in diverse online samples ( N = 5,285 across three studies, from Prolific.co). We
  observed an initial elevation on self-reports of negative subjective experiences
  such as mood and mental and physical health symptoms. Our findings show that the
  threats to validity posed by the phenomenon are real and need to be reckoned with.
