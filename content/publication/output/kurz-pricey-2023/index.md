abstract: Abstract  Price and quality are positively related in people's minds. Saying
  a product costs more ought to lead to higher expectations of quality and liking.
  Importantly, this price‐quality heuristic is argued to affect perceived quality
  and liking—known as the marketing placebo effect. To investigate the robustness
  of this effect, we conducted six studies (total N = 2842; with students from an
  international Dutch university and US participants from Prolific and MTurk)—expanding
  on previous methodological approaches with larger samples and using products not
  commonly investigated in previous research. In all our studies, higher prices led
  to higher quality and liking expectations as suggested by the price‐quality heuristic.
  However, we did not find a consistent effect on perceived quality and liking once
  people experienced the product. Our data imply that the marketing placebo effect
  may be less robust or generalizable as previously assumed. This (in)efficacy should
  bring marketers to pause on when and whether to rely on it at all.
