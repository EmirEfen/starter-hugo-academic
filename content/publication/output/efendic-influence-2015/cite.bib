 abstract = {The Monty Hall dilemma (MHD) presents an intriguing choice anomaly that
offers insight into human reasoning. It presents a specific subclass of
decision tasks that require the adequate use of Bayes theorem in order to
make optimal decisions. In the MHD, participants are presented with three
doors with only one door hiding the prize. After their initial choice of a
door, they are offered additional information. A different door (one that
does not hide the prize and one not chosen by the participant) is opened to
reveal nothing behind it. Afterwards, the participants are offered to stay
with their initial choice or to switch to the other remaining door. The
better strategy is to always switch; a counterintuitive one for most people.
We examine the notorious difficulty of the MHD from an affective perspective
while relying on the dual processing approach to thinking. We varied
participants? reliance on their affective reactions as opposed to a neutral
condition and hypothesized that the affective reactions associated with the
staying option contribute to worse performance on the task. Indeed, the
participants in the affective condition chose the staying option more often
than our control participants. Using the MHD as an appropriate paradigm of
conditional probability reasoning we show that, for this type of task, an
affective strategy is highly inefficient. We attribute these results to the
affective reactions associated with the staying option, with regret avoidance
associated with the switch option, and the conditional probability
construction of the dilemma.
