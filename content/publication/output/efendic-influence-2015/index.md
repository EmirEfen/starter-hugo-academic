abstract: The Monty Hall dilemma (MHD) presents an intriguing choice anomaly that
  offers insight into human reasoning. It presents a specific subclass of decision
  tasks that require the adequate use of Bayes theorem in order to make optimal decisions.
  In the MHD, participants are presented with three doors with only one door hiding
  the prize. After their initial choice of a door, they are offered additional information.
  A different door (one that does not hide the prize and one not chosen by the participant)
  is opened to reveal nothing behind it. Afterwards, the participants are offered
  to stay with their initial choice or to switch to the other remaining door. The
  better strategy is to always switch; a counterintuitive one for most people. We
  examine the notorious difficulty of the MHD from an affective perspective while
  relying on the dual processing approach to thinking. We varied participants? reliance
  on their affective reactions as opposed to a neutral condition and hypothesized
  that the affective reactions associated with the staying option contribute to worse
  performance on the task. Indeed, the participants in the affective condition chose
  the staying option more often than our control participants. Using the MHD as an
  appropriate paradigm of conditional probability reasoning we show that, for this
  type of task, an affective strategy is highly inefficient. We attribute these results
  to the affective reactions associated with the staying option, with regret avoidance
  associated with the switch option, and the conditional probability construction
  of the dilemma. ,  nema
