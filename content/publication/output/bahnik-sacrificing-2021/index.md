abstract: When asked whether to sacrifice oneself or another person to save others,
  one might think that people would consider sacrificing themselves rather than someone
  else as the right and appropriate course of action—thus showing an other-serving
  bias. So far however, most studies found instances of a self-serving bias—people
  say they would rather sacrifice others. In three experiments using trolley-like
  dilemmas, we tested whether an other-serving bias might appear as a function of
  judgment type. That is, participants were asked to make a prescriptive judgment
  (whether the described action should or should not be done) or a normative judgment
  (whether the action is right or wrong). We found that participants exhibited an
  other-serving bias only when asked whether self- or other-sacrifice is wrong. That
  is, when the judgment was normative and in a negative frame (in contrast to the
  positive frame asking whether the sacrifice is right). Otherwise, participants tended
  to exhibit a self-serving bias; that is, they approved sacrificing others more.
  The results underscore the importance of question wording and suggest that some
  effects on moral judgment might depend on the type of judgment.
