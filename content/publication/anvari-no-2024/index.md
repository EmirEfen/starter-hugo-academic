abstract: Research shows that people’s self-reports may be biased by an initial elevation
  phenomenon in which ratings are higher the first time that people take a survey
  as compared to the second and subsequent times. Apart from the fact that this phenomenon
  exists, and that it might bias ratings for negative subjective experiences more
  strongly than positive ones, little else is known. In the present study, we examined
  whether the initial elevation phenomenon occurs for commonly used trait measures,
  such as ratings on personality inventories and life satisfaction. We hypothesized
  that the initial elevation phenomenon may be associated with the (un)desirability
  of the content of the self-report items such that scores for undesirable facets
  would show initial elevation and scores for desirable facets would show the reverse.
  We tested this in an online convenience sample (N = 3,329) using 5 facets of a personality
  inventory and a single item measure of life satisfaction. Our hypotheses were not
  supported. Our findings suggest that at least for online convenience samples, ratings
  on personality inventories and life satisfaction are not strongly impacted by initial
  elevation.
