I'm a psychologist studying how people make judgments and decisions, with a focus on why they sometimes go wrong and how accuracy can be improved. My work combines psychology, behavioral economics, and management science to examine how individuals reason, choose, estimate, and forecast. Increasingly, I study how people's judgments can be leveraged on a collective level and what role, if any, AI systems can play in these interventions. 

I am an assistant professor at Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands where I teach and supervise students in the Department of Marketing and Supply-Chain Management. My research uses laboratory and online experiments and quantitative modeling to understand individual decisions.
