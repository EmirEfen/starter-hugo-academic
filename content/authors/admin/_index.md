I'm a psychologist working mostly in the domain of judgment and decision-making. In my research I look at a wide-range of topics focusing, in general, on how people make decisions, what impacts their choices, and finding ways to improve decision-making. I tackle these issues using lab or online experiments, applying a mostly quantitative approach to the analysis of behavior. 

I am an assistant professor at Maastricht University's School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands. There, I also teach various courses and supervise both Master and PhD students. Currently, I'm teaching a research methodology course for International Business Master students. 

Lately, I'm interested in how people judge decisions made by algorithmic systems, how people navigate risky prospects, and developing simple algorithms to extract accurate information from crowd judgments.
