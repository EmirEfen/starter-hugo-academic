	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}\&lt;p\&gt;Gotovo svi religijski tekstovi kao i religijska učenja zagovaraju toleranciju prema drugima, bilo da se to odnosi na pripadnike drugih vjera ili pripadnike drugih naroda. Prisustvo tzv. “Zlatnog pravila” koje se provlači kroz svete tekstove sve tri glavne Abrahamske religije se uzima kao primjer tolerantnog učenja i zagovaranja. No, iako je ova poveznica između religioznosti i tolerancije pretpostavljena, mnoga istraživanja su pokazala da je veća religioznost zapravo povezana sa većim predrasudama i negativnim stavovima naspram drugih osoba koje ne pripadaju vlastitoj grupi. Veza između religije i predrasuda je prethodno pokazana na populacijama zapadnih Europljana i Američkih Kršćana, no trenutno nije poznato da li, i u kolikoj mjeri, se ova poveznica može generalizirati na druge populacije i druge religije? Pogotovo ukoliko te populacije dolaze iz drugačijih socio-kulturoloških miljea. Da bi podrobnije ispitali ovu problematiku, proveli smo studiju koja je ispitivala povezanost između religioznosti kod Muslimanskih studenata u Bosni i Hercegovini, i njihovih stavova naspram drugih (vanjskih) grupa. Očekivana je jednaka negativna asocijacija religioznosti i tolerancije koje je prethodno pokazana na drugim uzorcima. Za mjerenje religioznosti i među-grupne identifikacije korištene su tri skale. i) Skala Intrinzične religioznosti, koja mjeri motivaciju za religioznim ponašanjem, a ne samo, overtno ponašanje. ii) Skala religijskog fundamentalizma, koja mjeri aspekte autoritarnog i fundamentalnog pristupa religiji, povezanih sa agresijom i vjerovanjem u Božansku istinu kao jedinu inherentnu i pravu. iii) Skala grupne identifikacije, koja se odnosila na nivo poistovjećivanja sa vlastitom grupom. Vanjske grupe koje su uključene u istraživanje su se sastojale od religijskih vanjskih grupa (npr. ateisti) i etničkih vanjskih grupa (npr. Srbi), kao i neutralnih grupa, npr. nezaposleni. U skladu sa očekivanjima pokazano je da što su osobe postizale veće rezultate na mjerama religioznosti, to su i pokazivale veću afektivnu distancu naspram drugih grupa. Na kraju, naši rezultati upućuju na negativnu asocijaciju između raznih dimenzija religioznosti i tolerancije. S time se rezultati prijašnjih istraživanja, dobivenih na drugačijem kulturološkom uzorku, mogu proširiti i na uzorak u Bosni i Hercegovini sa Muslimanskom vjeroispovijesti. \&lt;/p\&gt;{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Monty Hall dilemma (MHD) presents an intriguing choice anomaly that
   offers insight into human reasoning. It presents a specific subclass of
   decision tasks that require the adequate use of Bayes theorem in order to
   make optimal decisions. In the MHD, participants are presented with three
   doors with only one door hiding the prize. After their initial choice of a
   door, they are offered additional information. A different door (one that
   does not hide the prize and one not chosen by the participant) is opened to
   reveal nothing behind it. Afterwards, the participants are offered to stay
   with their initial choice or to switch to the other remaining door. The
   better strategy is to always switch; a counterintuitive one for most people.
   We examine the notorious difficulty of the MHD from an affective perspective
   while relying on the dual processing approach to thinking. We varied
   participants? reliance on their affective reactions as opposed to a neutral
   condition and hypothesized that the affective reactions associated with the
   staying option contribute to worse performance on the task. Indeed, the
   participants in the affective condition chose the staying option more often
   than our control participants. Using the MHD as an appropriate paradigm of
   conditional probability reasoning we show that, for this type of task, an
   affective strategy is highly inefficient. We attribute these results to the
   affective reactions associated with the staying option, with regret avoidance
   associated with the switch option, and the conditional probability
   construction of the dilemma.

Research methods and practices have come under increased scrutiny, with many issues identified as negatively contributing to low replicability and reproducibility of psychological research.Implications: As a consequence, researchers are increasingly called upon to overhaul and improve their research process. Various stakeholders within the scientific community are arguing for more openness and rigor within industrial and organisational (I-O) psychological research. A lack of transparency and openness further fuels criticisms as to the credibility and trustworthiness of I-O psychology which negatively affects the evidence-based practices which it supports. Furthermore, traditional gate-keepers such as grant agencies, professional societies and journals, are adapting their policies, reflecting an effort to curtail these trends.Purpose: The purpose of this opinion paper is, therefore, to stimulate an open dialogue with the South African Journal of Industrial Psychology (SAJIP) contributing authors, its editorial board and readership about the challenges associated with the replication crisis in psychology. Furthermore, it attempts to discuss how the identified issues affect I-O psychology and how these could be managed through open science practices and other structural improvements within the SAJIP.Recommendations: We enumerate several easily implementable open science practices, methodological improvements and editorial policy enhancements to enhance credibility and transparency within the SAJIP. Relying on these, we recommend changes to the current practices that can be taken up by researchers and the SAJIP to improve reproducibility and replicability in I-O psychological science.},

So far however, most studies found instances of a self-serving bias—people say they would rather sacrifice others. In three experiments using trolley-like dilemmas, we tested whether an other-serving bias might appear as a function of judgment type. That is, participants were asked to make a prescriptive judgment (whether the described action should or should not be done) or a normative judgment (whether the action is right or wrong). We found that participants exhibited an other-serving bias only when asked whether self- or other-sacrifice is wrong. That is, when the judgment was normative and in a negative frame (in contrast to the positive frame asking whether the sacrifice is right). Otherwise, participants tended to exhibit a self-serving bias; that is, they approved sacrificing others more. The results underscore the importance of question wording and suggest that some effects on moral judgment might depend on the type of judgment.},

            People occasionally face sure loss prospects. Do they seek risk in search of better outcomes or contend with the sure loss and focus on what is left to be saved? We addressed this question in three experiments akin to a negative interest rate framework. Specifically, we asked participants to allocate money (Experiments 1 and 2) or choose (Experiment 3) between two options: (i) a loss option where, for sure, they would end up with less, or (ii) a mixed gamble with a positive expected outcome, but also the possibility of an even larger loss. Risk aversion (i.e., choosing the sure loss) ranged from 80\% to 36\% across the three experiments, dependent on varied sizes of sure losses or expected outcomes. However, overall, the majority ({\textgreater} 50\%) of allocations and choices were for the sure loss. Our findings indicate a tolerance for sure losses at the expense of mixed gambles yielding much better expected outcomes. We discuss the implications of this sure-loss tolerance for psychological research, its implications in terms of (cumulative) prospect theory, and what the results mean for the implementation of negative interest rates.},

              When making risk judgments, people rely on availability and affect as convenient heuristics. The two heuristics share many similarities and yet there have been no or few attempts to ascertain their causal impact on risk judgments. We present an experiment (
              N
              = 143) where we varied availability‐by‐recall (thinking of less or more occurrences of someone from one's social network dying) and the affective impact of certain risks (using images). We found that availability‐by‐recall had a stronger impact in constructing risk judgments. Asking people to think of more occurrences led to higher judgments of mortality and higher values placed on a single life, irrespective of changes in affect, risk media coverage, and retrieval time. Affect, however, was not disregarded. Our data suggest a causal mechanism where the retrieval of occurrences leads to changes in affect, which in turn, impact risk judgments. These findings increase understanding of how risk judgments are constructed with the potential to impact risk communication through direct manipulations of availability and affect. We discuss these and other implications of our findings.},

Remarkably, similar principles apply when multiple estimates from the same person are aggregated, and a key challenge is to identify strategies that improve the accuracy of people’s aggregate estimates. Here, we present the following strategy: Combine people’s first estimate with their second estimate, made from the perspective of someone they often disagree with. In five preregistered experiments ( N = 6,425 adults; N = 53,086 estimates) with populations from the United States and United Kingdom, we found that such a strategy produced accurate estimates (compared with situations in which people made a second guess or when second estimates were made from the perspective of someone they often agree with). These results suggest that disagreement, often highlighted for its negative impact, is a powerful tool in producing accurate judgments.},

              Many service industries are facing severe labor shortages. As a result, service providers are turning to new sources of labor, such as service robots. Critics however often point out that service robots lack emotional communication capabilities without which they cannot be expected to truly replace human employees and fill the emerging labor market gaps. Here, a research agenda for the investigation of the role of emotional communication by service robots and its effects on customers and their service experience are laid out. This paper aims to propose that research in this area will further understanding of how service robots can add value to service frontlines, engage customers, increasingly replace service employees and ultimately help overcome pressing labor shortages.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A research agenda structured around the three-step emotional communication process (i.e. read, decide and express) and the four emotional communication strategies crucial for service interactions (i.e. mimicking, alleviating, infusing and preventing) are conceptualized.
            
            
              Findings
              Three contributions are made. First, the importance of emotional communication by service robots during service interactions is highlighted. Second, interdisciplinary research priorities and opportunities in this emerging field are mapped out. Third, a theoretical structure to connect the findings of future studies is provided.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Service research investigating the role and implications of emotional communication by service robots is scarce. A research agenda to guide the exploration of this crucial, yet underresearched component of customer-robot service interactions is structured and mapped out.},

Vice versa, increasing benefits leads people to judge its risks as lower (original: r = −.74 [−0.92, −0.30]). This finding is consistent with an affective explanation, and the negative relationship is often presented as evidence for an affect heuristic. In two well-powered studies, using a more stringent analytic strategy, we replicated the original finding. We observed a strong negative relationship between judgments of risks and benefits across three technologies, although we do find that there was no change in risks when highlighting low benefits. We note that risks seem to be more responsive to manipulation (as opposed to benefits) and find evidence that the negative relationship can depend on incidental mood.

              Price and quality are positively related in people's minds. Saying a product costs more ought to lead to higher expectations of quality and liking. Importantly, this price‐quality heuristic is argued to affect perceived quality and liking—known as the marketing placebo effect. To investigate the robustness of this effect, we conducted six studies (total
              N
               = 2842; with students from an international Dutch university and US participants from Prolific and MTurk)—expanding on previous methodological approaches with larger samples and using products not commonly investigated in previous research. In all our studies, higher prices led to higher quality and liking expectations as suggested by the price‐quality heuristic. However, we did not find a consistent effect on perceived quality and liking once people experienced the product. Our data imply that the marketing placebo effect may be less robust or generalizable as previously assumed. This (in)efficacy should bring marketers to pause on when and whether to rely on it at all.},

	abstract = {Researchers have long worried about a phenomenon where study participants give higher ratings on self-report scales the first time they take a survey compared to subsequent times, particularly for negative subjective experiences. Recent experimental evidence, using samples of U.S. college students, suggests that this initial elevation phenomenon is due to an upward bias in people’s initial responses. Such bias potentially undermines the validity of many research findings. However, more recent studies have found little evidence in support of the phenomenon. To investigate the robustness of the initial elevation phenomenon, we conducted the largest experiments to date in diverse online samples ( N = 5,285 across three studies, from Prolific.co). We observed an initial elevation on self-reports of negative subjective experiences such as mood and mental and physical health symptoms. Our findings show that the threats to validity posed by the phenomenon are real and need to be reckoned with.},

Despite its importance, replication efforts are few and far between in psychological science with many attempts failing to corroborate past findings. This scarcity, compounded by the difficulty in accessing replication data, jeopardizes the efficient allocation of research resources and impedes scientific advancement. Addressing this crucial gap, we present the Replication Database (https://forrt-replications.shinyapps.io/fred\_explorer), a novel platform hosting 1,239 original findings paired with replication findings. The infrastructure of this database allows researchers to submit, access, and engage with replication findings. The database makes replications visible, easily findable via a graphical user interface, and tracks replication rates across various factors, such as publication year or journal. This will facilitate future efforts to evaluate the robustness of psychological research.},

In the present study, we examined whether the initial elevation phenomenon occurs for commonly used trait measures, such as ratings on personality inventories and life satisfaction. We hypothesized that the initial elevation phenomenon may be associated with the (un)desirability of the content of the self-report items such that scores for undesirable facets would show initial elevation and scores for desirable facets would show the reverse. We tested this in an online convenience sample (N = 3,329) using 5 facets of a personality inventory and a single item measure of life satisfaction. Our hypotheses were not supported. Our findings suggest that at least for online convenience samples, ratings on personality inventories and life satisfaction are not strongly impacted by initial elevation.},
